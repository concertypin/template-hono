## Code Style Guide ðŸ¦„âœ¨

To keep our code super neat and sparkly, please follow these rules:

- **JavaScript:**
    - Avoid. Use TypeScript instead!
    - If you must, follow the same rules as TypeScript.
    - Use JSDoc comments, especially for functions.
    - Do not use common types like `Object`, `Any`. Use specific types.

- **TypeScript:**
    - Name files and folders in `kebab-case`.
    - Use `camelCase` for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for classes and types.
    - Write JSDoc comments as much as possible. Especially, add comments `@fires` and `@listens` for event-related functions.

- **Hono:**
    - MAKE a schema for each endpoint. Check out the route.ts file for examples. It is needed for generating OpenAPI docs.
    - Use middleware for common tasks like authentication, logging, etc.
    - Keep route handlers focused on a single task. We got the serverless power!
  
- **Commit Messages:**
    - Use Conventional Commits style. Check out [conventionalcommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for details.

- **Review:**
    - PRs should be reviewed by at least one friend(AI friend is friend too) before merging!

Letâ€™s keep everything tidy and readable so everyone can enjoy coding together~! (ï½¡â€¢Ì€á´—-)âœ§
